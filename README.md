# Telegram Music Recognition Bot

This project is a Telegram bot designed to recognize songs from voice messages or audio files. Built with Python and [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI), it listens for media files, analyzes them via a music recognition API ([Audd.io](https://audd.io/)), and replies with song details.
